# RedisLite
A small compact Redis written in go.

### Origin
This started as a small project challenge on codecrafters to test my skills with GO. I'm in the process of polishing, tidying up, and adding in the extra functions. The goals being, in order:

1. Complete the String functions
2. Add more complex types
3. Save to file (*.rdb) read and write functionality for strings
